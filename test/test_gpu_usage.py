#1. config: Track hyperparameters, architecture, dataset, and anything else you'd like to use to reproduce your model. These will show up in columnsâ€” use config columns to group, sort, and filter runs dynamically in the app.
#2. Project: A project is a set of experiments you can compare together. Each project gets a dedicated dashboard page, and you can easily turn on and off different groups of runs to compare different model versions.
#3.Notes: A quick commit message to yourself, the note can be set from your script and is editable in the table.
#4.Tags: Identify baseline runs and favorite runs. You can filter runs using tags, and they're editable in the table.
